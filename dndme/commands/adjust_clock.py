class AdjustClock(Command):

    keywords = ["clock", "time"]
    help_text = """{keyword}
{divider}
Summary: Set, adjust, or check the in-game time.

Usage: {keyword} [<time>|<time adjustment>]

Examples:

    > {keyword}
    The time is 00:00

    > {keyword} 13:37
    Okay; the time is now 13:37

    > {keyword} +1:30
    Okay; the time is now 15:07

    > {keyword} -15:07
    Okay; the time is now 00:00

Suggestions:

    * 1 simple task = 15 mins; 1 complex task = 1 hour
    * 10 minutes to search a room (and ask players which aspect:
            walls, floor, the barrels, etc.)
    * 5 minutes to disarm traps or pick a lock if proficient with
            thieves' tools; 10 minutes otherwise. This assumes fairly
            straightforward mechanisms, not complex puzzles.
    * Too much disagreement at the table about which way to go,
            or what to do, or where to look = 10 minutes and random
            encounter check.
    * 200 ft movement in a dungeon (slow) per 10 minutes. This
            allows characters to keep a simple map of where they are
            (if they want).
